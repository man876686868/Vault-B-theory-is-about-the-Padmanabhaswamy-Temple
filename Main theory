Core Hypothesis
Vault B = Divine Privacy Chamber, Not Cursed Vault
The sealed nature of Vault B stems from its designation as Lord Vishnu's private chamber, established when the Travancore royal family formally surrendered their kingdom to the deity, transforming from rulers to divine custodians.
Key Components
1. Historical Context: The Divine Surrender

The Travancore royal family officially surrendered their kingdom to Lord Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu)
This transformed their role from sovereign rulers to divine servants/caretakers
The temple became the true "ruler" of the kingdom
Royal family became custodians maintaining divine protocol

2. Vault B as Sacred Boundary

Not a threat-based seal → Privacy-based seal
Functions as cosmic "do not disturb" sign
Represents proper divine etiquette and boundaries
Maintains separation between human servants and divine personal space

3. Symbolic Architecture

The sealing reflects cosmic hierarchy and divine protocol
Physical barrier representing metaphysical boundaries
Architectural manifestation of the surrender agreement
Sacred space preservation through human restraint
